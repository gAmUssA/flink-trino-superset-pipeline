# project rules

## Makefile

- use make files when need to execute more than one command
- for Makefiles use emoji and ascii colors for better readability
- makefile should include smoketest task to validate startup of all docker containers 

## Java 

- use java 21 for building the project
- use gradle with Kotlin for build scripts
- use sdkman for managing SDKs

## Dockerfile and Docker Compose

- prefer to use https://orbstack.dev/  for managing docker containers (instead of docker desktop)
- for managing docker containers use docker compose and don't add version attribute for docker-compose.yaml file


## Documentation

- use asciidoc (*.adoc) for documentation and use emoji for better readability
- use one sentence per line in asciidoc
- PRD (Product Requirements Document) should be written in asciidoc
- convert markdown files to asciidoc
- use https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/diagram_types/mermaid/ for mermaid diagrams inside docs

## Git and Github

- use git for version control
- use github cli to interact with github
- greate gh actions based on commands in Makefile

## Kafka

- for kafka in docker use apache/kafka:3.9.0 image in Kraft more without zookeeper
- confluent platform (schema registry) version is 7.9.0


## Flink 

use Apache KafkaÂ® and Kafka Streams version 3.8.0+
use Apache Flink version v 1.20
for org.apache.flink:flink-connector-kafka dependency use version 3.4.0-1.20 <- this is correct version format 
prefer to use Flink Table API or Flink SQL instead of Flink DataStream API
