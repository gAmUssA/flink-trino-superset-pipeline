== 1. Project Overview

=== 1.1 Purpose
This project aims to create a comprehensive, end-to-end data pipeline using modern open-source technologies.
The pipeline will demonstrate the integration of streaming data processing, data storage, querying, and visualization capabilities in a portable, containerized environment.

=== 1.2 Components
The data pipeline will include the following components:

* 🚀 *Apache Kafka*: For real-time data ingestion and message queuing
* 🌊 *Apache Flink*: For stream processing and transformation
* ❄️ *Apache Iceberg*: For table format and data lake management
* 🔍 *Trino*: For distributed SQL query engine capabilities
* 📊 *Apache Superset*: For data visualization and dashboarding

=== 1.3 Goals

* Create a fully functional data pipeline that demonstrates real-time data processing
* Ensure all components are containerized using Docker Compose for portability
* Provide clear documentation for setup, configuration, and usage
* Demonstrate best practices for data engineering and architecture

== 2. System Architecture

=== 2.2 Component Interactions

1. *Data Source → Kafka*: Raw data is ingested into Kafka topics
2. *Kafka → Flink*: Flink consumes data from Kafka for processing
3. *Flink → Iceberg*: Processed data is written to Iceberg tables
4. *Iceberg → Trino*: Trino queries data stored in Iceberg format
5. *Trino → Superset*: Superset connects to Trino for data visualization

== 3. Functional Requirements

=== 3.1 Data Ingestion (Kafka)

* FR1.1: Support ingestion of sample data (e.g., user activity, sensor data)
* FR1.2: Provide multiple Kafka topics for different data types
* FR1.3: Ensure data is properly partitioned for parallel processing
* FR1.4: Include a data producer utility for generating sample data
* FR1.5: Include support of messages in Avro format and Schema Registry integration

=== 3.2 Stream Processing (Flink)

* FR2.1: Implement real-time data transformation and enrichment
* FR2.2: Support windowed aggregations (e.g., counts, averages over time)
* FR2.3: Detect patterns or anomalies in the data stream
* FR2.4: Provide checkpointing for fault tolerance
* FR2.4: Use Table API whenever Flink SQL won't suffice 

=== 3.3 Data Storage (Iceberg)

* FR3.1: Organize data in a structured table format
* FR3.2: Support schema evolution
* FR3.3: Implement partitioning strategies for efficient querying
* FR3.4: Enable time travel queries (historical data access)

=== 3.4 Data Querying (Trino)

* FR4.1: Support SQL queries across the data lake
* FR4.2: Enable joins between different data sources
* FR4.3: Provide query optimization for performance
* FR4.4: Support both batch and interactive queries

=== 3.5 Data Visualization (Superset)

* FR5.1: Create dashboards for key metrics
* FR5.2: Support various chart types (bar, line, pie, etc.)
* FR5.3: Enable filtering and drill-down capabilities
* FR5.4: Provide scheduled reports or alerts

== 4. Technical Requirements

=== 4.1 Containerization

* TR1.1: All components must be containerized using Docker
* TR1.2: Provide a docker-compose.yml file for easy deployment
* TR1.3: Ensure proper networking between containers
* TR1.4: Include volume mounts for persistent data

=== 4.2 Performance

* TR2.1: The system should handle at least 1000 events per second
* TR2.2: Query response time should be under 5 seconds for typical queries
* TR2.3: Dashboard loading time should be under 3 seconds

=== 4.3 Scalability

* TR3.1: Components should be configurable to scale horizontally
* TR3.2: Resource allocation should be adjustable via configuration

=== 4.4 Reliability

* TR4.1: Implement proper error handling and logging
* TR4.2: Ensure data consistency across the pipeline
* TR4.3: Support for component restarts without data loss

=== 4.5 Security

* TR5.1: Basic authentication for web interfaces
* TR5.2: Secure network communication between components
* TR5.3: Role-based access control for Superset dashboards
